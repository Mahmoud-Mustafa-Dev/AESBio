# AESBio

This open-source project is part of my masters thesis.

The main idea is to push for making biometrics more of a mainstream when trying to secure sensitive information 
on Android devices specially when dealing with digital payment.

In this implementation we use Advanced Encryption Standard and we allow users to encrypt data and require biometic
authentication in order to decrypt that data.

this library is still in the prototype phase, it is not recommended for production use.


in order to integrate with it add the following dependency into your gradle file

implementation 'com.github.Mahmoud-Mustafa-Dev:AESBio:versionName'
